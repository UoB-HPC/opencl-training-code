Development repository for the UoB-HPC 'Advanced HandsOnOpenCL'
material. At some point, this will probably become public, when we
have ironed out the various issues it currently has.

Managing Slides
===============
Although PowerPoint doesn't play well with Git, it's still useful to
track versions and have a history of who changed what and
when. PowerPoint for Mac has a reasonable 'compare and merge' facility
(under the 'Review' tab), which can be used if you encounter a merge
conflict. Email-based mutexes could also be used to reduce the risk of
conflicts.

TODO
====
- [ ] Merge pre-existing conflict for 'part2' slides (there's an 'sms' version)
- [ ] Update Host<->Device transfer exericse + slides with proper pinned mem approach
- [ ] Add zero-copy transfer to Host<->Device transfer exercise + slides
- [ ] Sort out Visual Studio solutions (try using VS 2010)
- [ ] Add Unix Makefiles
